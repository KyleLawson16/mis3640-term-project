## <a name="Idea">The Big Idea:</a>

The goal of our project is to utilize web scraping to help higher education institutions to gather career information about current students and alumni.  We will explore web scraping, data analysis and use of API’s. Our MVP will be able to scrape data from 3rd party websites and will include a basic interface for viewing the data. Our stretch goal is to create a user-friendly interface with more complex data relationships and analysis (i.e. charts, tables, trends, downloadable).

## <a name="Goals">Learning Goals:</a>

### Shared Learning Goals

All of us wish to explore more in the web scraping and data analyzing field using Python and we wish to actually create some useful tools that provide value to solving problems.
We also want to get introduced to new languages(JavaScript).
Learn and apply agile project management versus waterfall, where we will dive into coding and learning from our mistakes and constantly improving our final project.

### Individual Learning Goals

### Defne:
- Get comfortable coding
- Learn more about project management for a coding project
### Kyle:
- Learn how to create a web scraper that avoids bot detection
- Improve data analysis and algorithm skills with python
### Shirley:
- Have a decent understanding of how to problem solve using coding languages
- Experience actual project management that requires ourselves to code


## <a name="Implementation">Implementation Plan:</a>

We will be taking an agile approach to creating our project. This will allow us to organize tasks and learn from our mistakes. We will be continuously iterating while we work on every task so that we make sure mistakes are corrected at the point and will not be impacting the later tasks. In terms of resources, we will be looking into how other web scrapers have been created in the past. For example, we will be using [linkedin_scraper](https://github.com/joeyism/linkedin_scraper) as a resource when we get stuck, but will not be copying any code. Instead, we will use resources like this to give us a starting point and a basic structure for our code base. There are also plenty of articles and blog posts about how to create a basic web scraper like this: [web scraping tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/web-scraping-tutorial-python/).

## <a name="Schedule">Project Schedule:</a>

### Week of October 22nd,2018
- Research web scraping and develop a plan for where to start
- Research the best way to store our data
- Create a file structure

### Week of October 29th, 2018
- Begin building scraper bot for a simple website
- Learn more about how scrapers work and what the code behind them looks like

### Week of November 5th,2018
- Adapt our bot to work with LinkedIn or a different website with similar data
- Develop a way to store our data

### Week of November 12nd,2018
- Begin running the bot and debugging
- Collect data and begin researching how to build an interface and display data

### Week of November 19th, 2018- Thanksgiving!

### Week of November 26th, 2018
- Develop basic interface
- Develop basic data analysis algorithms

### Week of December 3rd,2018
- Create more complicated data visualizations if we have time
- Prep for presentation

### Final Presentation date: December 6th,2018


## <a name="Collaboration">Collaboration Plan:</a>

We will be taking an agile approach to creating our project. This will allow us to organize tasks and learn from our mistakes. We will be continuously iterating while we work on every task so that we make sure mistakes are corrected at the point and will not be impacting the later tasks. We will be in communication through WhatsApp and Slack and will be meeting in Map Hill, Trim and Horn Library meeting rooms.

## <a name="Risks">Risks:</a>

Our biggest risk is that LinkedIn’s bots will be very intelligent and will make it very difficult for us to scrape data without being banned. In order to get around this, we will be placing limiters on our scraper and running it slower than normal. If we still run into issues with this tactic, we will look towards other websites with similar data like Glassdoor or Handshake.
